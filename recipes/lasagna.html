      <h2>Description</h2>
        
        <p> From what I can tell, the secret behind Alton's lasagna is the addition of a little sugar
        to the sauce and using a bit more cheese than most other recipes.
        There are a few minor tweaks to his original recipe that I found necessary, for example adding a dash of wine vinegar to the sauce and changing the amount of Parmesan cheese.
